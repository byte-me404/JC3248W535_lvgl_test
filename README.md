# JC3248W535 AXS15231B LVGL V9 Test Repo
A basic example is provided to run the [JC3248W535](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007566332450.html) display with Arduino and LVGL. This project uses the [Arduino_GFX@V1.5.0](https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFX) libary and [LVGL@V9.2.2](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl). A dedicated libary was written for the touch driver.
